<blockquote>
I like to innovate, with a focus on streamlining delivery and improving quality. I have experience architecting software solutions that span multiple logical and physical tiers. I have experience architecting high performance software and websites that scale elastically. I am the person that starts at an organisation that has been manually deploying their 15 year old massively complex and antiquated legacy system, and 3 months later, I have driven the adoption of a fully automated CI / CD process running on docker or in the cloud so that value is now being delivered continuously, consistently, and relatively eï¬€ortlessly. I do not consider my job done once my code is checked into source control. I consider my job done well, once fully tested and high quality code is being shipped into production (not just from me, but from the entire team) - along with the right telemetry and monitoring to help inform the business and drive continuous improvement.
